 This repository will contain some of the basic scripts used during the performance of a High-ThroughPut Masterâ€™s 5-week project in an academic lab.
 Key words: genomics, data analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, pipeline design, RNA velocity.  
 I will not update the tools ; but any recommandation is welcomed !
